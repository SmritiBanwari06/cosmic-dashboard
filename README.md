Cosmic Dashboard âœ¨ - An Interactive NASA API Explorer

Cosmic Dashboard is a beautifully designed web application that brings the wonders of space to your fingertips. Built using NASA's public APIs, it provides an interactive and user-friendly experience to explore cosmic data, from stunning daily astronomical images to photos snapped by rovers on Mars.

Description
The goal of this project is to transform raw, complex data from NASA into a visually compelling and intuitive "mission control" dashboard. Instead of just presenting JSON data, Cosmic Dashboard focuses on creating a narrative and an experience, allowing users to discover and learn about our universe in an engaging way. This project was built to demonstrate modern frontend development skills, including API integration, data visualization, and responsive UI/UX design.

Features
Interactive Dashboard: A central hub that provides a quick overview of the latest space phenomena.

Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD): An immersive, full-screen viewer to explore NASA's daily featured image, complete with a date picker to travel back in time.

Mars Rover Photo Gallery: Browse thousands of photos from rovers like Perseverance and Curiosity. Features advanced filtering by Martian day (sol) and camera type.

Asteroid Watch: A 3D interactive globe that visualizes the trajectories of Near-Earth Objects, paired with a sortable data table for detailed information.

Tech Stack
This project is built with a modern frontend stack:

Framework: React (or Vue/Svelte)

3D Graphics: Three.js / React Three Fiber

Styling: CSS Modules / Styled-Components / Tailwind CSS

Data Fetching: Axios with React Query for caching

Routing: React Router
